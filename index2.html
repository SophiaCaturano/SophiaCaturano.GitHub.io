        <h1> Welcome to Sophia's Programming Portfolio! </h1>
        <p> My name is Sophia Caturano and this Website is a look into my portfolio of programs that I have written for the CSC106 Computer Programming Course at <em> the University of Rhode Island.</em> The Javascripts link above has the Javascripts that I have written to be embedded in web pages, The App link above has apps I have written that can run on phones, and the About me link above brings you to a page where you can learn more about me! :) </p>
